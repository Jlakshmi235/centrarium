Iâ€™m a graduate of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science - Pilani, where I earned my BE in Computer Science. Currently, I am pursuing a Masters degree also in Computer Science from Northwestern University. 

After briefly working as a software developer in Dubai, I wanted to make use of my qualitative, quantitative and programming skills by transitioning to Data Science. In order to start my journey as a Data Scientist, I enrolled for the 12 week intensive bootcamp offered at [Metis Chicago](https://www.thisismetis.com) in the Summer of 2017.

In my blog, I will be writing about the data science and machine learning projects I have done at school and Metis.

I will be completing my Masters in December 2017. I am actively looking for Data Science positions to kickstart my career!
