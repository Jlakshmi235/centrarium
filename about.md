I am drawn to problems that involve creative and analytical thinking. Particularly, I am interested in using data to extract insights and tell stories. I am currently working as a research data scientist in the interdisciplinary Health Aware Bits [(HABits) Lab](http://thehabitslab.com), affiliated with the Department of Preventive Medicine at Northwestern Fienberg School of Medicine, under the guidance of [Prof Nabil Alshurafa](http://nalshurafa.me). My work here entails data wrangling, modeling and visualizations to derive data-driven insights about human behavior. I am also experienced at communicating complex analyses and findings through storytelling and visualizations.

My background is in Computer Science. After briefly working as a software developer in Dubai, I wanted to make use of my qualitative, quantitative and programming skills by transitioning to Data Science. In order to start my journey as a Data Scientist, I enrolled for a 12 week intensive bootcamp offered at [Metis Chicago](https://www.thisismetis.com) in the Summer of 2017. My time at Metis helped me to hone my programming, statistcal and analytical skills, which are key to being a good data scientist. 

I will be posting my data science projects and highlighting interesting things I learn along the way.
